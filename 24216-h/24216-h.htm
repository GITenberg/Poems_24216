11</span>LINES WRITTEN AT NIGHT.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">August 9th, 1825.</p>
<p>Oh, thou surpassing beauty! that dost live<br />
Shrined in yon silent stream of glorious light!<br />
Spirit of harmony! that through the vast<br />
And cloud-embroidered canopy art spreading<br />
Thy wings, that o&rsquo;er our shadowy earth hang brooding,<br />
Like a pale silver haze, betwixt the moon<br />
And the world&rsquo;s darker orb: beautiful, hail!<br />
Hail to thee! from her midnight throne of ether,<br />
Night looks upon the slumbering universe.<br />
There is no breeze on silver-crown&euml;d tree,<br />
There is no breath on dew-bespangled flower,<br />
There is no wind sighs on the sleepy wave,<br />
There is no sound hangs in the solemn air.<br />
<!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>All, all are silent, all are dreaming, all,<br />
Save those eternal eyes, that now shine forth<br />
Winking the slumberer&rsquo;s destinies.&nbsp; The moon<br />
Sails on the horizon&rsquo;s verge, a moving glory,<br />
Pure, and unrivalled; for no paler orb<br />
Approaches, to invade the sea of light<br />
That lives around her; save yon little star,<br />
That sparkles on her robe of fleecy clouds,<br />
Like a bright gem, fallen from her radiant brow.</p>
<h2><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>VENICE.</h2>
<p>Night in her dark array<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Steals o&rsquo;er the ocean,<br />
And with departed day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hushed seems its motion.<br />
Slowly o&rsquo;er yon blue coast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Onward she&rsquo;s treading,<br />
&rsquo;Till its dark line is lost,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Neath her veil spreading.<br />
The bark on the rippling deep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath found a pillow,<br />
And the pale moonbeams sleep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the green billow.<br />
Bound by her emerald zone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Venice is lying,<br />
And round her marble crown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Night winds are sighing.<br />
From the high lattice now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bright eyes are gleaming,<br />
That seem on night&rsquo;s dark brow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Brighter stars beaming.<br />
<!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>Now o&rsquo;er the bright lagune<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Light barks are dancing,<br />
And &rsquo;neath the silver moon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Swift oars are glancing.<br />
Strains from the mandolin<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Steal o&rsquo;er the water,<br />
Echo replies between<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To mirth and laughter.<br />
O&rsquo;er the wave seen afar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Brilliantly shining,<br />
Gleams like a fallen star<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Venice reclining.</p>

15</span>TO MISS ---</h2>
<p>Time beckons on the hours: the expiring year<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Already feels old Winter&rsquo;s icy breath;<br />
As with cold hands, he scatters on her bier<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The faded glories of her Autumn wreath.<br />
As fleetly as the Summer&rsquo;s sunshine past,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Winter&rsquo;s snow must melt; and the young
Spring,<br />
Strewing the earth with flowers, will come at last,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in her train the hour of parting bring.<br />
But, though I leave the harbour, where my heart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometime had found a peaceful resting-place,<br />
Where it lay calmly moored; though I depart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, let not time my memory quite efface.<br />
&rsquo;Tis true, I leave no void, the happy home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To which you welcomed me, will be as gay,<br />
As bright, as cheerful, when I&rsquo;ve turned to roam,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Once more, upon life&rsquo;s weary onward way.<br />
<!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>But oh! if ever by the warm hearth&rsquo;s blaze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where beaming eyes and kindred souls are met,<br />
Your fancy wanders back to former days,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let my remembrance hover round you yet.<br />
Then, while before you glides time&rsquo;s shadowy train,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of forms long vanished, days and hours long gone,<br
/>
Perchance my name will be pronounced again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In that dear circle where I once was one.<br />
Think of me then, nor break kind memory&rsquo;s spell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By reason&rsquo;s censure coldly o&rsquo;er me
cast,<br />
Think only, that I loved ye passing well!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And let my follies slumber with the past.</p>
<h2><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>THE WIND.</h2>
<p>Night comes upon the earth; and fearfully<br />
Arise the mighty winds, and sweep along<br />
In the full chorus of their midnight song.<br />
The waste of heavy clouds, that veil the sky,<br />
Roll like a murky scroll before them driven,<br />
And show faint glimpses of a darker heaven.<br />
No ray is there of moon, or pale-eyed star,<br />
Darkness is on the universe; save where<br />
The western sky lies glimmering, faint and far,<br />
With day&rsquo;s red embers dimly glowing there.<br />
Hark! how the wind comes gathering in its course,<br />
And sweeping onward, with resistless force,<br />
Howls through the silent space of starless skies,<br />
And on the breast of the swol&rsquo;n ocean dies.<br />
Oh, though art terrible, thou viewless power!<br />
That rid&rsquo;st destroying at the midnight hour!<br />
We hear thy mighty pinion, but the eye<br />
Knows nothing of thine awful majesty.<br />
<!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>We see all mute creation bow before<br />
Thy viewless wings, as thou careerest o&rsquo;er<br />
This rocking world; that in the boundless sky<br />
Suspended, vibrates, as thou rushest by.<br />
There is no terror in the lightning&rsquo;s glare,<br />
That breaks its red track through the trackless air;<br />
There is no terror in the voice that speaks<br />
From out the clouds when the loud thunder breaks<br />
Over the earth, like that which dwells in thee,<br />
Thou unseen tenant of immensity.</p>
<h2><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>EASTERN SUNSET.</h2>
<p>&rsquo;Tis only the nightingale&rsquo;s warbled strain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That floats through the evening sky:<br />
With his note of love, he replies again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the muezzin&rsquo;s holy cry;<br />
As it sweetly sounds on the rosy air,<br />
&ldquo;Allah, il allah! come to prayer!&rdquo;<br />
Warm o&rsquo;er the waters the red sun is glowing,<br />
&rsquo;Tis the last parting glance of his splendour and might,<br
/>
While each rippling wave on the bright shore is throwing<br />
Its white crest, that breaks into showers of light.<br />
Each distant mosque and minaret<br />
Is shining in the setting sun,<br />
Whose farewell look is brighter yet,<br />
Than that with which his course begun.<br />
On the dark blue mountains his smile is bright,<br />
It glows on the orange grove&rsquo;s waving height,<br />
<!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>And breaks through its shade in long lines of light.<br
/>
No sound on the earth, and no sound in the sky,<br />
Save murmuring fountains that sparkle nigh,<br />
And the rustling flight of the evening breeze,<br />
Who steals from his nest in the cypress trees,<br />
And a thousand dewy odours fling,<br />
As he shakes their white buds from his gossamer wing,<br />
And flutters away through the spicy air,<br />
At sound of a footstep drawing near.</p>
<h2><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>FAREWELL TO ITALY.</h2>
<p>Farewell awhile, beautiful Italy!<br />
My lonely bark is launched upon the sea<br />
That clasps thy shore, and the soft evening gale<br />
Breathes from thy coast, and fills my parting sail.<br />
Ere morning dawn, a colder breeze will come,<br />
And bear me onward to my northern home;<br />
That home, where the pale sun is not so bright,<br />
So glorious, at his noonday&rsquo;s fiercest height,<br />
As when he throws his last glance o&rsquo;er the sea,<br />
And fires the heavens, that glow farewell on thee.<br />
Fair Italy! perchance some future day<br />
Upon thy coast again will see me stray;<br />
Meantime, farewell!&nbsp; I sorrow, as I leave<br />
Thy lovely shore behind me, as men grieve<br />
When bending o&rsquo;er a form, around whose charms,<br />
Unconquered yet, Death winds his icy arms:<br />
While leaving the last kiss on some dear cheek,<br />
Where beauty sheds her last autumnal streak,<br />
<!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>Life&rsquo;s rosy flower just mantling into bloom,<br />
Before it fades for ever in the tomb.<br />
So I leave thee, oh! thou art lovely still!<br />
Despite the clouds of infamy and ill<br />
That gather thickly round thy fading form:<br />
Still glow thy glorious skies, as bright and warm,<br />
Still memory lingers fondly on thy strand,<br />
And Genius hails thee still her native land.<br />
Land of my soul&rsquo;s adoption! o&rsquo;er the sea,<br />
Thy sunny shore is fading rapidly:<br />
Fainter and fainter, from my gaze it dies,<br />
&rsquo;Till like a line of distant light it lies,<br />
A melting boundary &rsquo;twixt earth and sky,<br />
And now &rsquo;tis gone;&mdash;farewell, fair Italy!</p>
<h2><!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>THE RED INDIAN.</h2>
<p>Rest, warrior, rest! thine hour is past,&mdash;<br />
Thy longest war-whoop, and thy last,<br />
Still rings upon the rushing blast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That o&rsquo;er thy grave sweeps drearily.</p>
<p>Rest, warrior, rest! thy haughty brow,<br />
Beneath the hand of death bends low,<br />
Thy fiery glance is quench&euml;d now,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the cold grave&rsquo;s obscurity.</p>
<p>Rest, warrior, rest! thy rising sun<br />
Is set in blood, thy day is done;<br />
Like lightning flash thy race is run,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thou art sleeping peacefully.</p>
<p>Rest, warrior, rest! thy foot no more<br />
The boundless forest shall explore,<br />
Or trackless cross the sandy shore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or chase the red deer rapidly.</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>Rest, warrior, rest! thy light canoe,<br />
Like thy choice arrow, swift and true,<br />
Shall part no more the waters blue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That sparkle round it brilliantly.</p>
<p>Rest, warrior, rest! thine hour is past,<br />
Yon sinking sunbeam is thy last,<br />
And all is silent, save the blast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That o&rsquo;er thy grave sweeps drearily.</p>
<h2>TO ---</h2>
<p>Oh, turn those eyes away from me!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though sweet, yet fearful are their rays;<br />
And though they beam so tenderly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel, I tremble &rsquo;neath their gaze.<br />
Oh, turn those eyes away! for though<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To meet their glance I may not dare,<br />
I know their light is on my brow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the warm blood that mantles there.</p>
<h2><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>SONG.</h2>
<p>Yet once again, but once, before we sever,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fill we one brimming cup,&mdash;it is the last!<br
/>
And let those lips, now parting, and for ever,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Breathe o&rsquo;er this pledge, &ldquo;the memory of
the past!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joy&rsquo;s fleeting sun is set; and no to-morrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Smiles on the gloomy path we tread so fast,<br />
Yet, in the bitter cup, o&rsquo;erfilled with sorrow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lives one sweet drop,&mdash;the memory of the
past.</p>
<p>But one more look from those dear eyes, now shining<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through their warm tears, their loveliest and their
last;<br />
But one more strain of hands, in friendship twining,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now farewell all, save memory of the past.</p>
<h2><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>LAMENT FOR ISRAEL.</h2>
<p>Where is thy home in thy promised land?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Desolate and forsaken!<br />
The stranger&rsquo;s arm hath seized thy brand,<br />
Thou art bowed beneath the stranger&rsquo;s hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the stranger thy birthright hath taken.</p>
<p>Where is the mark of thy chosen race?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Infamous and degraded!<br />
It hath fallen on thee, on thy dwelling-place,<br />
And that heaven-stamped sign to a foul disgrace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the scoff of the world, has faded.</p>
<p>First-born of nations! upon thy brow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Resistless and revenging,<br />
The fiery finger of God hath now<br />
Written the sentence of thy wo,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The innocent blood avenging!</p>
<p><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>Lion of Judah! thy glory is past,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Vanished and fled for ever.<br />
Homeless and scattered, thy race is cast<br />
Like chaff in the breath of the sweeping blast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To rally or rise again, never!</p>
<h2>A WISH.</h2>
<p>Let me not die for ever, when I&rsquo;m gone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the cold earth! but let my memory<br />
Live like the gorgeous western light that shone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the clouds where sank day&rsquo;s majesty.<br
/>
Let me not be forgotten! though the grave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has clasped its hideous arms around my brow.<br />
Let me not be forgotten! though the wave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of time&rsquo;s dark current rolls above me now.<br
/>
Yet not in tears remembered be my name;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Weep over those ye loved; for me, for me,<br />
Give me the wreath of glory, and let fame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Over my tomb spread immortality!</p>
<h2><!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>SONG.</h2>
<p>The moment must come, when the hands that unite<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the firm clasp of friendship, will sever;<br />
When the eyes that have beamed o&rsquo;er us brightly
to-night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will have ceased to shine o&rsquo;er us, for
ever.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet wreathe again the
goblet&rsquo;s brim<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With
pleasure&rsquo;s roseate crown!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What though the future hour be
dim&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The present is
our own!</p>
<p>The moment is come, and again we are parting,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To roam through the world, each our separate way;<br
/>
In the bright eye of beauty the pearl-drop is starting,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But hope, sunny hope, through the tear sheds its
ray.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!-- page 29--><a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>Then wreathe
again the goblet&rsquo;s brim<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With
pleasure&rsquo;s roseate crown!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What though the present hour be
dim&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
future&rsquo;s yet our own!</p>
<p>The moment is past, and the bright throng that round us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So lately was gathered, has fled like a dream;<br />
And time has untwisted the fond links that bound us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like frost wreaths that melt in the morning&rsquo;s
first beam.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still wreathe once more the
goblet&rsquo;s brim!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With
pleasure&rsquo;s roseate crown!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What though all else beside be
dim&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The past has
been our own!</p>

30</span>TO MRS. ---</h2>
<p>Oh lady! thou, who in the olden time<br />
Hadst been the star of many a poet&rsquo;s dream!<br />
Thou, who unto a mind of mould sublime,<br />
Weddest the gentle graces that beseem<br />
Fair woman&rsquo;s best! forgive the darling line<br />
That falters forth thy praise! nor let thine eye<br />
Glance o&rsquo;er the vain attempt too scornfully;<br />
But, as thou read&rsquo;st, think what a love was mine,<br />
That made me venture on a theme, that none<br />
Can know thee, and not feel a hopeless one.<br />
Thou art most fair, though sorrow&rsquo;s chastening wing<br />
Hath past, and left its shadow on thy brow,<br />
And solemn thoughts are gently mellowing<br />
The splendour of thy beauty&rsquo;s summer now.<br />
Thou art most fair! but thine is loveliness<br />
That dwells not only on the lip, or eye;<br />
Thy beauty, is thy pure heart&rsquo;s holiness;<br />
Thy grace, thy lofty spirit&rsquo;s majesty.<br />
<!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>While thus I gaze on thee, and watch thee glide,<br />
Like some calm spirit o&rsquo;er life&rsquo;s troubled stream,<br
/>
With thy twin buds of beauty by thy side<br />
Together blossoming; I almost deem<br />
That I behold the loveliness and truth,<br />
That like fair visions hovered round my youth,<br />
Long sought&mdash;and then forgotten as a dream.</p>
<h2>A WISH.</h2>
<p>Let me not die for ever when I&rsquo;m laid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the cold earth! but let my memory<br />
Live still among ye, like the evening shade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That o&rsquo;er the sinking day steals placidly.<br
/>
Let me not be forgotten! though the knell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has tolled for me its solemn lullaby;<br />
Let me not be forgotten! though I dwell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For ever now in death&rsquo;s obscurity.<br />
Yet oh! upon the emblazoned leaf of fame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Trace not a record, not a line for me,<br />
But let the lips I loved oft breathe my name,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in your hearts enshrine my memory!</p>

32</span>A SPIRIT&rsquo;S VOICE.</h2>
<p>It is the dawn! the rosy day awakes;<br />
From her bright hair pale showers of dew she shakes,<br />
And through the heavens her early pathway takes;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Why art thou sleeping?</p>
<p>It is the noon! the sun looks laughing down<br />
On hamlet still, on busy shore, and town,<br />
On forest glade, and deep dark waters lone;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Why art thou sleeping?</p>
<p>It is the sunset! daylight&rsquo;s crimson veil<br />
Floats o&rsquo;er the mountain tops, while twilight pale<br />
Calls up her vaporous shrouds from every vale;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Why art thou sleeping?</p>
<p>It is the night! o&rsquo;er the moon&rsquo;s livid brow,<br />
Like shadowy locks, the clouds their darkness throw,<br />
All evil spirits wake to wander now;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Why art thou sleeping?</p>
<h2><!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>TO THE DEAD.</h2>
<p>On the lone waters&rsquo; shore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wander I yet;<br />
Brooding those moments o&rsquo;er<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I should forget.<br />
&rsquo;Till the broad foaming surge<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Warns me to fly,<br />
While despair&rsquo;s whispers urge<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To stay and die.<br />
When the night&rsquo;s solemn watch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Falls on the seas,<br />
&rsquo;Tis thy voice that I catch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the low breeze;<br />
When the moon sheds her light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On things below,<br />
Beams not her ray so bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like thy young brow?<br />
Spirit immortal! say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When wilt thou come,<br />
To marshal me the way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To my long home?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sing
the yellow leaf,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That rustling strews<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wintry path,
where grief<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Delights to muse,<br />
Spring&rsquo;s early violet, that sweetly opes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its fragrant leaves to the young morning&rsquo;s
kiss,<br />
Type of our youth&rsquo;s fond dreams, and cherished hopes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will soon be this:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sere and
yellow leaf,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That rustling strews<br />

37</span>A WISH.</h2>
<p>Oh! that I were a fairy sprite, to wander<br />
In forest paths, o&rsquo;erarched with oak and beech;<br />
Where the sun&rsquo;s yellow light, in slanting rays,<br />
Sleeps on the dewy moss: what time the breath<br />
Of early morn stirs the white hawthorn boughs,<br />
And fills the air with showers of snowy blossoms.<br />
Or lie at sunset &rsquo;mid the purple heather,<br />
Listening the silver music that rings out<br />
From the pale mountain bells, swayed by the wind.<br />
Or sit in rocky clefts above the sea,<br />
While one by one the evening stars shine forth<br />
Among the gathering clouds, that strew the heavens<br />
Like floating purple wreaths of mournful nightshade!</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; In one crystal sheet, like the summer&rsquo;s sky
bright!<br />
Oh let it be where the sun, when retreating,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May throw the last glance of his vanishing light.<br
/>
Lay me there! lay me there! and upon my lone pillow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let the emerald moss in soft starry wreaths
swell;<br />
Be my dirge the faint sob of the murmuring billow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the burthen it sings to me, nought but
&ldquo;farewell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh let it be where soft slumber enticing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The cypress and myrtle have mingled their shade:<br
/>
Oh let it be where the moon at her rising,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May throw the first night-glance that silvers the
glade.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; From its strings, now forsaken, may sound one

<p>When we first met, dark wintry skies were glooming,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the wild winds sang requiem to the year;<br />
But thou, in all thy beauty&rsquo;s pride wert blooming,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And my young heart knew hope without a fear.</p>
<p>When we last parted, summer suns were smiling,<br />

But thou hadst lost the power of beguiling,<br />

Peace hath no dwelling here, but evermore<br />

With thy sweet liquid notes, by some strong spell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Compelled to minister to his delight!<br />
Whence, what art thou? art thou a fairy wight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Caught sleeping in some lily&rsquo;s snowy bell,<br

Where thou hadst crept, to rock in the moonlight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And drink the starry dew-drops, as they fell?<br />
Say, dost thou think, sometimes when thou art singing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of thy wild haunt upon the mountain&rsquo;s brow,<br
/>
Where thou wert wont to list the heath-bells ringing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sail upon the sunset&rsquo;s amber glow?<br />
When thou art weary of thy oft-told theme,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Say, dost thou think of the clear pebbly stream,<br

Upon whose mossy brink thy fellows play,<br />
<!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Oh! if thou couldst, and we could hear thy prayer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How would thy little voice beseeching cry,<br />
For one short draught of the sweet morning air,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For one short glimpse of the clear azure sky!<br />
Perchance thou sing&rsquo;st in hope thou shalt be free,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweetly and patiently thy task fulfilling;<br />
While thy sad thoughts are wandering with the bee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To every bud with honey dew distilling.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy homeward flight back to the greenwood gay,<br />
Thou&rsquo;dst be a shunned and a forsaken thing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Mongst the companions of thy happier day.<br

For fairy sprites, like many other creatures,<br />

woe.<br />

<p>Lady, sweet lady, I behold thee yet,<br />
With thy pale brow, brown eyes, and solemn air,<br />
And billowy tresses of thy golden hair,<br />
Which once to see, is never to forget!<br />

Upon thee; and the limner&rsquo;s art divine,<br />
Meantime, poured all thy spirit into mine.<br />
But once I gazed, then on my way I went:<br />
And thou art still before me.&nbsp; Like a dream<br />
Of what our soul has loved, and lost for ever,<br />
Thy vision dwells with me, and though I never<br />
May be so blest as to behold thee more,<br />
That one short look has stamped thee in my heart,<br />

Of all the wild imaginings that man<br />
Hath peopled heaven, and earth, and ocean with;<br />
Making fair nature&rsquo;s solitary haunts<br />
Alive with beings, beautiful and fearful.<br />
And as the chain of thought grew link by link,<br />
It seemed, as though the midnight heavens waxed brighter,<br />
The stars gazed fix&rsquo;dly with their golden eyes,<br />
And a strange light played o&rsquo;er each sleeping billow,<br />
That laid its head upon the sandy beach.<br />
Anon there came along the rocky shore<br />
A far-off sound of sweetest minstrelsy.<br />

Filling my soul with thrilling, fearful pleasure.<br />
It swelled, as though borne on the floating wings<br />

The coast was peopled with a world of elves,<br />
Who in fantastic ringlets danced around,<br />
With antic gestures, and wild beckoning motion,<br />
Aimed at the moon.&nbsp; White was their snowy vesture,<br />
And shining as the Alps, when that the sun<br />
Gems their pale robes with diamonds.&nbsp; On their heads<br />
Were wreaths of crimson and of yellow foxglove.<br />
They were all fair, and light as dreams; anon<br />
The dance broke off; and sailing through the air,<br />
Some one way, and some other, they did each<br />
Alight upon some waving branch, or flower,<br />
That garlanded the rocks upon the shore.<br />
One, chiefly, did I mark, one tiny sprite,<br />
Who crept into an orange flower-bell,<br />
And there lay nestling, whilst his eager lips<br />
Drank from its virgin chalice the night dew,<br />

Gazing in love and wonder on thy flood.<br />

No laughing cry, to hail thy victory,<br />

Chased by thy billows far along the sand.<br />

Through whose dark screen no prying sunbeams break:<br />
How oft I dream I see thee wandering,<br />
With thy majestic mien, and thoughtful eyes,<br />
And lips, whereon all holy counsel lies,<br />
And shining tresses of soft rippling gold,<br />
Like to some shape beheld in days of old<br />
By seer or prophet, when, as poets sing,<br />
The gods had not forsaken yet the earth,<br />
But loved to haunt each shady dell and grove;<br />
When ev&rsquo;ry breeze was the soft breath of love,<br />
When the blue air rang with sweet sounds of mirth,<br />
And this dark world seemed fair as at its birth.</p>

62</span>THE VISION OF LIFE.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death and I,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On a hill so high,<br />
Stood side by side:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And we saw below,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Running to and fro,<br />
All things that be in the world so wide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten thousand cries<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the gulf did rise,<br />
With a wild discordant sound;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Laughter and wailing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Prayer and railing,<br />
As the ball spun round and round.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And over all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hung a floating pall<br />
Of dark and gory veils:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the blood of years,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the sighs and tears,<br />
Which this noisome marsh exhales.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span

&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a fearful dream,<br />
Till Death cried with a joyful cry:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Look down! look down!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It is all mine own,<br />
Here comes life&rsquo;s pageant by!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like to a masque in ancient revelries,<br />
With mingling sound of thousand harmonies,<br />
Soft lute and viol, trumpet-blast and gong,<br />
They came along, and still they came along!<br />
Thousands, and tens of thousands, all that e&rsquo;er<br />
Peopled the earth, or ploughed th&rsquo; unfathomed deep,<br />
All that now breathe the universal air,<br />
And all that in the womb of Time yet sleep.</p>
<p>Before this mighty host a woman came,<br />
With hurried feet, and oft-averted head;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With accursed light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes were bright,<br />
And with inviting hand them on she beckoned.<br />
Her followed close, with wild acclaim,<br />
Her servants three: Lust, with his eye of fire,<br />
And burning lips, that tremble with desire,<br />
Pale sunken cheek:&mdash;and as he staggered by,<br />
<!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>The trumpet-blast was hush&rsquo;d, and there arose<br
/>
A melting strain of such soft melody,<br />
As breath&rsquo;d into the soul love&rsquo;s ecstacies and
woes.<br />
Loudly again the trumpet smote the air,<br />
The double drum did roll, and to the sky<br />
Bay&rsquo;d War&rsquo;s bloodhounds, the deep artillery;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Glory,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With feet all gory,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And dazzling eyes, rushed by,<br />
Waving a flashing sword and laurel wreath,<br />
The pang, and the inheritance of death.</p>
<p>He pass&rsquo;d like lightning&mdash;then ceased every
sound<br />
Of war triumphant, and of love&rsquo;s sweet song,<br />
And all was silent&mdash;Creeping slow along,<br />
With eager eyes, that wandered round and round,<br />
Wild, haggard mien, and meagre, wasted frame,<br />
Bow&rsquo;d to the earth, pale, starving Av&rsquo;rice came:<br
/>
Clutching with palsied hands his golden god,<br />
And tottering in the path the others trod.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These, one by one,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Came and were gone:<br />
And after them followed the ceaseless stream<br />
Of worshippers, who, with mad shout and scream,<br />
Unhallow&rsquo;d toil, and more unhallow&rsquo;d mirth,<br />
Follow their mistress, Pleasure, through the earth.<br />
<!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>Death&rsquo;s eyeless sockets glared upon them all,<br
/>
And many in the train were seen to fall,<br />
Livid and cold, beneath his empty gaze;<br />
But not for this was stay&rsquo;d the mighty throng,<br />
Nor ceased the warlike clang, or wanton lays,<br />
But still they
rush&rsquo;d&mdash;along&mdash;along&mdash;along!</p>

With me, poor child of sin!&mdash;Angel of love!<br />
Whose guardian wings hung o&rsquo;er me from my birth,<br />

Over the wayward deeds, the thoughts of pride,<br />

From thy sad task dost thou in anger turn;<br />
But patiently, thou hast but gazed and sighed,<br />
And followed still, striving with the divine<br />
Powers of thy soul for mastery over mine;<br />
And though all line of human hope be past,<br />
Still fondly watching, hoping, to the last.</p>

<p>Suggested by Sir Thomas Lawrence observing that we never dream
of ourselves younger than we are.</p>
<p>Not in our dreams, not even in our dreams,<br />
May we return to that sweet land of youth,<br />
That home of hope, of innocence, and truth,<br />
Which as we farther roam but fairer seems.<br />
In that dim shadowy world, where the soul strays<br />
When she has laid her mortal charge to rest,<br />
We oft behold far future hours and days,<br />
But ne&rsquo;er live o&rsquo;er the past, the happiest,<br />
How oft will fancy&rsquo;s wild imaginings<br />
Bear us in sleep to times and worlds unseen!<br />
But ah! not e&rsquo;en unfettered fancy&rsquo;s wings<br />
Can lead us back to aught that we have been,<br />
Or waft us to that smiling, sunny shore,<br />

<p>Whene&rsquo;er I recollect the happy time<br />
When you and I held converse dear together,<br />
There come a thousand thoughts of sunny weather,<br />
Of early blossoms, and the fresh year&rsquo;s prime;<br />
Your memory lives for ever in my mind<br />
With all the fragrant beauties of the spring,<br />
With od&rsquo;rous lime and silver hawthorn twined,<br />
And many a noonday woodland wandering.<br />
There&rsquo;s not a thought of you, but brings along<br />
Some sunny dream of river, field, and sky;<br />
&rsquo;Tis wafted on the blackbird&rsquo;s sunset song,<br />
Or some wild snatch of ancient melody.<br />
And as I date it still, our love arose<br />
&rsquo;Twixt the last violet and the earliest rose.</p>

Youngest and fairest of the four, who guide<br />
Our mortal year along Time&rsquo;s rapid tide.<br />
Spirit of life! the old decrepid earth<br />
Has heard thy voice, and at a wondrous birth,<br />
Forth springing from her dark, mysterious womb,<br />
A thousand germs of light and beauty come.<br />
Thy breath is on the waters, and they leap<br />
From their bright winter-woven fetters free;<br />
Along the shore their sparkling billows sweep,<br />
And greet thee with a gush of melody.<br />
The air is full of music, wild and sweet,<br />
Made by the joyous waving of the trees,<br />
Wherein a thousand winged minstrels meet,<br />
And by the work-song of the early bees,<br />
In the white blossoms fondly murmuring,<br />
And founts, that in the blessed sunshine sing;<br />

Out of the clouds to hear thee?&nbsp; Who shall say,<br />
Thou lone one! that thy melody is gay,<br />
Let him come listen now to that one note,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That thou art pouring o&rsquo;er and o&rsquo;er

Through the sweet echoes of thy mellow throat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With such a sobbing sound of deep, deep pain,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; For athwart the leaden sky<br />
The heavy clouds came gathering<br />

Shook the burthen of its weeping<br />

The waterfall rushed swollen down,<br />

With a foam-wreath on the angry brow<br />

In answer to a question.</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell thee why this weary world meseemeth<br />
But as the visions light of one who dreameth,<br />
Which pass like clouds, leaving no trace behind;<br />
Why this strange life, so full of sin and folly,<br />
In me awakeneth no melancholy,<br />
Nor leaveth shade, or sadness, on my mind.<br />
&rsquo;Tis not that with an undiscerning eye<br />
I see the pageant wild go dancing by,<br />
Mistaking that which falsest is, for true;<br />
&rsquo;Tis not that pleasure hath entwined me,<br />
&rsquo;Tis not that sorrow hath enshrined me;<br />
I bear no badge of roses or of rue,<br />
But in the inmost chambers of my soul<br />
There is another world, a blessed home,<br />
O&rsquo;er which no living power holdeth control,<br />
Anigh to which ill things do never come.<br />
There shineth the glad sunlight of clear thought,<br />
With hope, and faith, holding communion high,<br />
Over a fragrant land with flowers wrought,<br />
Where gush the living springs of poesy;<br />
<!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

There smile the glances that I love to see,<br />
There live the forms of those my soul holds dear,<br />
For ever, in that secret world, with me.<br />
They who have walked with me along life&rsquo;s way,<br />
And sever&rsquo;d been by Fortune&rsquo;s adverse tide,<br />
Who ne&rsquo;er again, through Time&rsquo;s uncertain day,<br />
In weal or woe, may wander by my side;<br />
These all dwell here: nor these, whom life alone<br />
Divideth from me, but the dead, the dead;<br />
Those weary ones who to their rest are gone,<br />
Whose footprints from the earth have vanish&euml;d;<br />
Here dwell they all: and here, within this world,<br />
Like light within a summer sun cloud furled,<br />
My spirit dwells.&nbsp; Therefore, this evil life,<br />
With all its gilded snares, and fair deceivings,<br />
Its wealth, its want, its pleasures, and its grievings,<br />
Nor frights, nor frets me, by its idle strife.<br />
O thou! who readest, of thy courtesy,<br />
Whoe&rsquo;er thou art, I wish the same to thee!</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; The fairies&rsquo; palace beside the stream;<br />
Where the yellow sun-rays at morning fall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through their tresses dark, with a mellow gleam.</p>
<p>I shall tread no more the thick dewy lawn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the young moon hangs on the brow of night,<br

Nor see the morning, at early dawn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shake the fading stars from her robes of light.</p>
<p>I shall fly no more on my fiery steed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er the springing sward,&mdash;through the

Still find ye cold, and dead, and dark, as night&mdash;<br />
Oh, lifeless eyes! can ye not answer me?<br />
Oh, lips! whereon mine own so often dwell,<br />
Hath love&rsquo;s warm, fearful, thrilling touch, no spell<br />

In eddying whirls of passion, dizzily.<br />
When thou art gone, there creeps into my heart<br />
A cold and bitter consciousness of pain:<br />
The light, the warmth of life, with thee depart,<br />

Thy greeting clasp, thy parting look, and tone;<br />
And suddenly I wake&mdash;and am alone.</p>

Of some lone isle, lost in the unknown seas;<br />
Whose golden sands by mortal foot before<br />
Were never printed,&mdash;where the fragrant breeze,<br />
That never swept o&rsquo;er land or flood that man<br />
Could call his own, th&rsquo; unearthly breeze shall fan<br />
Our mingled tresses with its odorous sighs;<br />
Where the eternal heaven&rsquo;s blue, sunny eyes<br />
Did ne&rsquo;er look down on human shapes of earth,<br />
Or aught of mortal mould and death-doomed birth:<br />
Come there with me; and when we are alone<br />
In that enchanted desert, where the tone<br />
Of earthly voice, or language, yet did ne&rsquo;er<br />
With its strange music startle the still air,<br />
When clasped in thy upholding arms I stand,<br />
Upon that bright world&rsquo;s coral-cradled strand,<br />
When I can hide my face upon thy breast,<br />
While thy heart answers mine together pressed,<br />
Then fold me closer, bend thy head above me,<br />
Listen&mdash;and I will tell thee how I love thee.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon that darling of the sea,<br />
Where neither sunshine, rain, nor snow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For three days hold supremacy;<br />

The blessings of all climes to lend,<br />

Thy beechen woods, thy heathery mountains,<br />
Thy lawny uplands, where the shadow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of many a giant oak is sleeping;<br />
The tangled copse, the sunny meadow,<br />

Beneath the sky?&mdash;a great, big thought,<br />

POINT.</h2>
<p>Were they but dreams?&nbsp; Upon the darkening world<br />
Evening comes down, the wings of fire are furled,<br />
On which the day soared to the sunny west:<br />
The moon sits calmly, like a soul at rest,<br />
Looking upon the never-resting earth;<br />
All things in heaven wait on the solemn birth<br />
Of night, but where has fled the happy dream<br />
That at this hour, last night, our life did seem?<br />
Where are the mountains with their tangled hair,<br />
The leafy hollow, and the rocky stair?<br />
Where are the shadows of the solemn hills,<br />
And the fresh music of the summer rills?<br />
Where are the wood-paths, winding, long and steep,<br />
And the great, glorious river, broad and deep,<br />
And the thick copses, where soft breezes meet,<br />
And the wild torrent&rsquo;s snowy, leaping feet,<br />
The rustling, rocking boughs, the running streams,&mdash;<br />
Where are they all? gone, gone! were they but dreams?<br />
<!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

That from the mountain-side came dancing down?<br />
The voices full of mirth, the loving eyes,<br />
The happy hearts, the human paradise,<br />
The youth, the love, the life that revelled here,&mdash;<br />
Are they too gone?&mdash;Upon Time&rsquo;s shadowy bier,<br />
The pale, cold hours of joys now past, are laid,<br />
Perhaps, not soon from memory&rsquo;s gaze to fade,<br />
But never to be reckoned o&rsquo;er again,<br />
In all life&rsquo;s future store of bliss and pain.<br />
From the bright eyes the sunshine may depart,<br />
Youth flies&mdash;love dies&mdash;and from the joyous heart<br />
Hope&rsquo;s gushing fountain ebbs too soon away,<br />
Nor spares one drop for that disastrous day,<br />
When from the barren waste of after life,<br />
The weariness, the worldliness, the strife,<br />
The soul looks o&rsquo;er the desert of its way<br />
To the green gardens of its early day:<br />
The paradise, for which we vainly mourn,<br />
The heaven, to which our ling&rsquo;ring eyes still turn,<br />
To which our footsteps never shall return.</p>

Which through these woods, in other days,<br />
Startled the echoes of the chase.<br />
On trooped the vision; lord and dame,<br />
On fiery steed and palfrey tame,<br />
Pilgrims, with palms and cockle-shells,<br />
And motley fools, with cap and bells,<br />
Princes and Counties Palatine,<br />
Who ruled and revelled on the Rhine,<br />
<!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>Abbot and monk, with many a torch,<br />
Came winding from each convent porch;<br />
And holy maids from Nonnenwerth,<br />
In the pale moonlight all came forth;<br />
Thy love, Roland, among the rest,<br />
Her meek hands folded on her breast,<br />
Her sad eyes turned to heaven, where thou<br />
Once more shalt hear love&rsquo;s early vow,&mdash;<br />
That vow, which led thee home again<br />
From Roncevalles&rsquo; bloody plain,&mdash;<br />
That vow, that ne&rsquo;er again was spoken<br />
Till death the nun&rsquo;s drear oath had broken.<br />
Down from each crumbling castle poured,<br />
Of ruthless robber-knights, the horde,<br />
Sweeping with clang and clamour by,<br />
Like storm-cloud rattling through the sky:<br />
Pageant so glorious ne&rsquo;er, I ween,<br />
On lonely river bank was seen.</p>
<p>So passed that night: but with the day<br />
The vision melted all away;<br />
And wrapped in sullen mist and rain,<br />
The river bore us on again,<br />
With heavy hearts and tearful eyes,<br />
That answered well the weeping skies<br />
<!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>Of autumn, which now hung o&rsquo;er all<br />
The scene their leaden, dropping pall,<br />
Beneath whose dark gray veils, once more<br />
We hailed our native Albion&rsquo;s shore,<br />
Our pilgrimage of pleasure o&rsquo;er.</p>
<h2>LINES FOR MUSIC.</h2>
<p>Good night! from music&rsquo;s softest spell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to thy dreams: and in thy slumbers,<br />
Fairies, with magic harp and shell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sing o&rsquo;er to thee thy own sweet numbers.</p>
<p>Good night! from Hope&rsquo;s intense desire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to thy dreams: and may to-morrow,<br />
Love with the sun returning, fire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These evening mists of doubt and sorrow.</p>
<p>Good night! from hours of weary waking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll to my dreams: still in my sleep<br />
To feel the spirit&rsquo;s restless aching,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And ev&rsquo;n with eyelids closed, to weep.</p>
<h2><!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>SONNET.</h2>
<p>Say thou not sadly, &ldquo;never,&rdquo; and &ldquo;no
more,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But from thy lips banish those falsest words;<br />
While life remains that which was thine before<br />
Again may be thine; in Time&rsquo;s storehouse lie<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Days, hours, and moments, that have unknown
hoards<br />
Of joy, as well as sorrow: passing by,<br />
Smiles, come with tears; therefore with hopeful eye<br />
Look thou on dear things, though they turn away,<br />
For thou and they, perchance, some future day<br />
Shall meet again, and the gone bliss return;<br />
For its departure then make thou no mourn,<br />
But with stout heart bid what thou lov&rsquo;st farewell;<br />
That which the past hath given the future gives as well.</p>
<h2>SONNET.</h2>
<p>Though thou return unto the former things,<br />
Fields, woods, and gardens, where thy feet have strayed<br />
<!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>In other days, and not a bough, branch, blade<br />
Of tree, or meadow, but the same appears<br />
As when thou lovedst them in former years,<br />
They shall not <i>seem</i> the same; the spirit brings<br />
Change from the inward, though the outward be<br />
E&rsquo;en as it was, when thou didst weep to see<br />
It last, and spak&rsquo;st that prophecy of pain,<br />
&ldquo;Farewell!&nbsp; I shall not look on ye again!&rdquo;<br />
And so thou never didst&mdash;no, though e&rsquo;en now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thine eyes behold all they so loved of yore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>Thou</i> that did behold them then, no
more<br />
Lives in this world, it is another Thou.</p>
<h2>SONNET.</h2>
<p>Like one who walketh in a plenteous land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By flowing waters, under shady trees,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through sunny meadows, where the summer bees<br />
Feed in the thyme and clover; on each hand<br />
Fair gardens lying, where of fruit and flower<br />
The bounteous season hath poured out its dower:<br />
Where saffron skies roof in the earth with light,<br />
And birds sing thankfully towards Heaven, while he<br />
<!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>With a sad heart walks through this jubilee,<br />
Beholding how beyond this happy land,<br />
Stretches a thirsty desert of gray sand,<br />
Where all the air is one thick, leaden blight,<br />
Where all things dwarf and dwindle,&mdash;so walk I,<br />
Through my rich, present life, to what beyond doth lie.</p>
<h2>SONNET.</h2>
<p>Blaspheme not thou thy sacred life, nor turn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er joys that God hath for a season lent,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Perchance to try thy spirit, and its bent,<br />
Effeminate soul and base! weakly to mourn.<br />
There lies no desert in the land of life,<br />
For e&rsquo;en that tract that barrenest doth seem,<br />
Laboured of thee in faith and hope, shall teem<br />
With heavenly harvests and rich gatherings, rife.<br />
Haply no more, music, and mirth and love,<br />
And glorious things of old and younger art,<br />
Shall of thy days make one perpetual feast;<br />
<!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>But when these bright companions all depart,<br />
Lay thou thy head upon the ample breast<br />
Of Hope, and thou shalt hear the angels sing above.</p>
<h2>SONNET.</h2>
<p>But to be still! oh, but to cease awhile<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The panting breath and hurrying steps of life,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sights, the sounds, the struggle, and the
strife<br />
Of hourly being; the sharp biting file<br />
Of action, fretting on the tightened chain<br />
Of rough existence; all that is not pain,<br />
But utter weariness; oh! to be free<br />
But for a while from conscious entity!<br />
To shut the banging doors and windows wide,<br />
Of restless sense, and let the soul abide<br />
Darkly and stilly, for a little space,<br />
Gathering its strength up to pursue the race;<br />
Oh, Heavens! to rest a moment, but to rest<br />
From this quick, gasping life, were to be blest!</p>

Through half thy pilgrimage, with fellows gay,<br />
Love, youth, and hope, under the rosy bloom<br />
And temperate airs, of early breaking day;<br />

There cease the trees to shade, the flowers to spring,<br />

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
